Debugging - Part 1
==================

Indications that something is not right.

* message
	* A generic notification/diagnostic message produced by the message function
	* Execution of the function continues
* warning
	* An indication that something is wrong but not necessarily fatal
	* Execution of the function continues
	* Generation by the warning function
* error
	* An indication that a fatal problem has occurred
	* Execution stops
	* Produced by the stop function
* condition
	* A generic concept for indicating that something unexpected can occur
	* Programmers can create their own conditions

Warnings:

	> log(-1)
	[1] NaN
	Warning message:
	In log(-1) : NaNs produced

Example:

	> printmessage <- function(x) {
	+ 	if(x > 0)
	+ 		print("x is greater than zero")
	+ 	else
	+ 		print("x is less than or equal to zero")
	+ 	invisible(x)
	+ }

	> printmessage(1)
	[1] "x is greater than zero"

	> printmessage(NA)
	Error in if (x > 0) print("x is greater than zero") else print("x is less than or equal to zero") : missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed

Another example:

	> printmessage2 <- function(x) {
	+ 	if(is.na(x))
	+ 		print("x is a missing value!")
	+ 	else if(x > 0)
	+ 		print("x is greater than zero")
	+ 	else
	+ 		print("x is less than or equal to zero")
	+ 	invisible(x)
	+ }
	> x <- log(-1)
	Warning message:
	In log(-1) : NaNs produced
	> printmessage2(x)
	[1] "x is a missing value!"

How do you know that something is wrong with your function?

* What was you input? How did you call the function?
* What were you expecting? Output, message, other results?
* What did you get?
* How does what you get differ from what you were expecting?
* Were your expectations correct in the first place?
* Can you reproduce the problem (exactly)?

Debugging - Part 2
==================

The primary tools for debugging functions in R are:

* traceback
	* Prints out the function call stack after an error occurs
	* Does nothing if there's no error
* debug: Flags a function for debug mode which allows you to step through execution of a function in debug mode
* browser
	* Suspends the execution of a function wherever it is called and puts the function in debug mode
* trace: allows you to insert debugging code into a function in specific places
* recover: allows you to modify the error behavior so that you can browse the function call stack

These are interactive tools specifically designed to allow you to pick through a function.   
There's also the more blunt technique of inserting print/cat statements in the function.


Debugging - Part 3
==================

traceback()
-----------

	> mean(x)
	Error in mean(x) : object 'x' not found
	> traceback()
	1: mean(x)
	>

Example:

	> lm(y - x)
	Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos) : object 'y' not found
	> traceback()
	7: eval(expr, envir, enclos)
	6: eval(prevars, data, env)
	5: model.frame.default(formula = y - x, drop.unused.levels = TRUE)
	4: model.frame(formula = y - x, drop.unused.levels = TRUE)
	3: eval(expr, envir, enclos)
	2: eval(mf, parent.frame())
	1: lm(y - x)


debug()
-------

	> debug(lm)
	> lm(y - x)
	debugging in: lm(y - x)
	debug: {
	    ret.x <- x
	    ret.y <- y
	    cl <- match.call()
	â€¦
	    if (!qr) 
	        z$qr <- NULL
	    z
	}
	Browse[2]> n
	debug: ret.x <- x
	Browse[2]> n
	debug: ret.y <- y
	Browse[2]> n
	debug: cl <- match.call()
	Browse[2]> n
	debug: mf <- match.call(expand.dots = FALSE)
	Browse[2]> n
	debug: m <- match(c("formula", "data", "subset", "weights", "na.action", 
	    "offset"), names(mf), 0L)


recover()
---------

	> options(error = recover)
	> read.csv('nosuchfile')
	Error in file(file, "rt") : cannot open the connection
	In addition: Warning message:
	In file(file, "rt") :
	  cannot open file 'nosuchfile': No such file or directory
	
	Enter a frame number, or 0 to exit   
	
	1: read.csv("nosuchfile")
	2: read.table(file = file, header = header, sep = sep, quote = quote, dec = dec, fil
	3: file(file, "rt")
	
	Selection: 


Summary
-------

* There are three main indications of a problem/condition: message, warning, error
	* Only an error is fatal
* When analyzing a function with a problem, make sure you can reproduce the problem. clearly state your expectations and how the output differs from your expectation
* Interactive debugging tools traceback, debug, browser, trace, and recover can be used to find problematic code in functions
* Debugging tools are not a substitute for thinking!
